for a stack the top most item is added and removed. 
for a queue the oldest item the item farthest to the right is removed first
and all items are added on the left side.

Linked List is O(1) time complexity
hash tables are O(n) time complexity
binary search tree is O(log n) time complexity

the advantages of a hash table over an array is that it takes a consistent ammount of time to every type of action on data. while an array is Linear time meaning the larger the data the more time it will take for different actions
